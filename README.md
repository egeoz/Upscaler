# Upscaler

**Sharpen your low-resolution pictures with the power of AI upscaling**<br/><br/>
Upscaler is a neural network based image upscaling application for Android built with
the [MNN deep learning framework](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN)
and [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN).<br/><br/>

The input image is processed in tiles on the device GPU, using a pre-trained Real-ESRGAN model. The
tiles are then merged into the final high-resolution image. This application requires Vulkan or
OpenCL support and Android 7 or above
